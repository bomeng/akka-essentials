# Examples from Akka Essentials
This repo is in fact a fork of [Akka-Essentials](https://github.com/write2munish/Akka-Essentials). I update the code for the latest version of Akka.

I suggest that the following sections should be skipped when reading the awesome but outdated book:
+ Chapter7 
  - Coordinated transactions
  - Transactor
+ Chapter 11
  - Actors and Web Applications
